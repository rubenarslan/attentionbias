## these directives mean: unless it's actually a file or directory. that means only not found ones are rewritten
## that means: my 500s who are probably loops, never actually get to /app/webroot/index.php


## if I add RewriteBase / to the root htaccess, proper files get redirected.
## this means, the redirection to /app/webroot works, but index.php is not found
## actually this was the fix and I just forgot to upload the tmp dir (it was skipped due to my transmit rules)

### adding a slash before index.php doesn't fix it, I get the HU 500 (not the "500 500"), static files still work
#### removing RewriteBase / in root leads to 500-500s, static don't work anymore.


# RewriteBase / in all 3 htaccess - only static works
# RewriteBase to their respective location - doesn't work

# dev: no slash somewhere
# prod: slash somewhere


# also auf dem HU server muss RewriteBase / in root gesetzt sein und in webroot muss ein Slash vor /index.php
